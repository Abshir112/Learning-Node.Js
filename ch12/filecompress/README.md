# File Compression App

This app removes whitespace and comments from HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files. It's a simple file read/write demonstration and is not intended for real use.

To run the example, navigate to this directory in your terminal and run:

```sh
node filecompress.js ./test/example.html ./test/output.html
```

Where `./test/example.html` is an input file and `./test/output.html` is an output file.
